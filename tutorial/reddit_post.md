# General discussion post

[Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/LLMDevs/comments/1n98lsf/building_rag_systems_at_enterprise_scale_20k_docs/) original post.

Been building RAG systems for mid-size enterprise companies in the regulated space (100-1000 employees) for the past year and to be honest, this stuff is way harder than any tutorial makes it seem. Worked with around 10+ clients now - pharma companies, banks, law firms, consulting shops. Thought I'd share what actually matters vs all the basic info you read online.

Quick context: most of these companies had 10K-50K+ documents sitting in SharePoint hell or document management systems from 2005. Not clean datasets, not curated knowledge bases - just decades of business documents that somehow need to become searchable.

**Document quality detection: the thing nobody talks about**

This was honestly the biggest revelation for me. Most tutorials assume your PDFs are perfect. Reality check: enterprise documents are absolute garbage.

I had one pharma client with research papers from 1995 that were scanned copies of typewritten pages. OCR barely worked. Mixed in with modern clinical trial reports that are 500+ pages with embedded tables and charts. Try applying the same chunking strategy to both and watch your system return complete nonsense.

Spent weeks debugging why certain documents returned terrible results while others worked fine. Finally realized I needed to score document quality before processing:

* Clean PDFs (text extraction works perfectly): full hierarchical processing
* Decent docs (some OCR artifacts): basic chunking with cleanup
* Garbage docs (scanned handwritten notes): simple fixed chunks + manual review flags

Built a simple scoring system looking at text extraction quality, OCR artifacts, formatting consistency. Routes documents to different processing pipelines based on score. This single change fixed more retrieval issues than any embedding model upgrade.



**Why fixed-size chunking is mostly wrong**

Every tutorial: "just chunk everything into 512 tokens with overlap!"

Reality: documents have structure. A research paper's methodology section is different from its conclusion. Financial reports have executive summaries vs detailed tables. When you ignore structure, you get chunks that cut off mid-sentence or combine unrelated concepts.

Had to build hierarchical chunking that preserves document structure:

* Document level (title, authors, date, type)
* Section level (Abstract, Methods, Results)
* Paragraph level (200-400 tokens)
* Sentence level for precision queries

The key insight: query complexity should determine retrieval level. Broad questions stay at paragraph level. Precise stuff like "what was the exact dosage in Table 3?" needs sentence-level precision.

I use simple keyword detection - words like "exact", "specific", "table" trigger precision mode. If confidence is low, system automatically drills down to more precise chunks.



**Metadata architecture matters more than your embedding model**

This is where I spent 40% of my development time and it had the highest ROI of anything I built.

Most people treat metadata as an afterthought. But enterprise queries are crazy contextual. A pharma researcher asking about "pediatric studies" needs completely different documents than someone asking about "adult populations."

Built domain-specific metadata schemas:

**For pharma docs:**

* Document type (research paper, regulatory doc, clinical trial)
* Drug classifications
* Patient demographics (pediatric, adult, geriatric)
* Regulatory categories (FDA, EMA)
* Therapeutic areas (cardiology, oncology)

**For financial docs:**

* Time periods (Q1 2023, FY 2022)
* Financial metrics (revenue, EBITDA)
* Business segments
* Geographic regions

Avoid using LLMs for metadata extraction - they're inconsistent as hell. Simple keyword matching works way better. Query contains "FDA"? Filter for regulatory\_category: "FDA". Mentions "pediatric"? Apply patient population filters.

Start with 100-200 core terms per domain, expand based on queries that don't match well. Domain experts are usually happy to help build these lists.

**When semantic search fails (spoiler: a lot)**

Pure semantic search fails way more than people admit. In specialized domains like pharma and legal, I see 15-20% failure rates, not the 5% everyone assumes.

**Main failure modes that drove me crazy:**

**Acronym confusion:** "CAR" means "Chimeric Antigen Receptor" in oncology but "Computer Aided Radiology" in imaging papers. Same embedding, completely different meanings. This was a constant headache.

**Precise technical queries:** Someone asks "What was the exact dosage in Table 3?" Semantic search finds conceptually similar content but misses the specific table reference.

**Cross-reference chains:** Documents reference other documents constantly. Drug A study references Drug B interaction data. Semantic search misses these relationship networks completely.

**Solution:** Built hybrid approaches. Graph layer tracks document relationships during processing. After semantic search, system checks if retrieved docs have related documents with better answers.

For acronyms, I do context-aware expansion using domain-specific acronym databases. For precise queries, keyword triggers switch to rule-based retrieval for specific data points.

## Why I went with open source models (Qwen specifically)

Most people assume GPT-4o or o3-mini are always better. But enterprise clients have weird constraints:

* **Cost:** API costs explode with 50K+ documents and thousands of daily queries
* **Data sovereignty:** Pharma and finance can't send sensitive data to external APIs
* **Domain terminology:** General models hallucinate on specialized terms they weren't trained on

Qwen QWQ-32B ended up working surprisingly well after domain-specific fine-tuning:

* 85% cheaper than GPT-4o for high-volume processing
* Everything stays on client infrastructure
* Could fine-tune on medical/financial terminology
* Consistent response times without API rate limits

Fine-tuning approach was straightforward - supervised training with domain Q&A pairs. Created datasets like "What are contraindications for Drug X?" paired with actual FDA guideline answers. Basic supervised fine-tuning worked better than complex stuff like RAFT. Key was having clean training data.

**Table processing: the hidden nightmare**

Enterprise docs are full of complex tables - financial models, clinical trial data, compliance matrices. Standard RAG either ignores tables or extracts them as unstructured text, losing all the relationships.

Tables contain some of the most critical information. Financial analysts need exact numbers from specific quarters. Researchers need dosage info from clinical tables. If you can't handle tabular data, you're missing half the value.

**My approach:**

* Treat tables as separate entities with their own processing pipeline
* Use heuristics for table detection (spacing patterns, grid structures)
* For simple tables: convert to CSV. For complex tables: preserve hierarchical relationships in metadata
* Dual embedding strategy: embed both structured data AND semantic description

For the bank project, financial tables were everywhere. Had to track relationships between summary tables and detailed breakdowns too.



**Production infrastructure reality check**

Tutorials assume unlimited resources and perfect uptime. Production means concurrent users, GPU memory management, consistent response times, uptime guarantees.

Most enterprise clients already had GPU infrastructure sitting around - unused compute or other data science workloads. Made on-premise deployment easier than expected.

Typically deploy 2-3 models:

* Main generation model (Qwen 32B) for complex queries
* Lightweight model for metadata extraction
* Specialized embedding model

Used quantized versions when possible. Qwen QWQ-32B quantized to 4-bit only needed 24GB VRAM but maintained quality. Could run on single RTX 4090, though A100s better for concurrent users.

Biggest challenge isn't model quality - it's preventing resource contention when multiple users hit the system simultaneously. Use semaphores to limit concurrent model calls and proper queue management.

## Key lessons that actually matter

**1. Document quality detection first:** You cannot process all enterprise docs the same way. Build quality assessment before anything else.

**2. Metadata > embeddings:** Poor metadata means poor retrieval regardless of how good your vectors are. Spend the time on domain-specific schemas.

**3. Hybrid retrieval is mandatory:** Pure semantic search fails too often in specialized domains. Need rule-based fallbacks and document relationship mapping.

**4. Tables are critical:** If you can't handle tabular data properly, you're missing huge chunks of enterprise value.

**5. Infrastructure determines success:** Clients care more about reliability than fancy features. Resource management and uptime matter more than model sophistication.

**The real talk**

Enterprise RAG is way more engineering than ML. Most failures aren't from bad models - they're from underestimating the document processing challenges, metadata complexity, and production infrastructure needs.

The demand is honestly crazy right now. Every company with substantial document repositories needs these systems, but most have no idea how complex it gets with real-world documents.

Anyway, this stuff is way harder than tutorials make it seem. The edge cases with enterprise documents will make you want to throw your laptop out the window. But when it works, the ROI is pretty impressive - seen teams cut document search from hours to minutes.

Happy to answer questions if anyone's hitting similar walls with their implementations.

# Technical discussion post

[Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/LLMDevs/comments/1nl9oxo/i_built_rag_systems_for_enterprises_20k_docs/) original post.

Hey everyone, I’m Raj. Over the past year I’ve built RAG systems for 10+ enterprise clients – pharma companies, banks, law firms – handling everything from 20K+ document repositories, deploying air‑gapped on‑prem models, complex compliance requirements, and more.

In this post, I want to share the actual learning path I followed – what worked, what didn’t, and the skills you really need if you want to go from toy demos to production-ready systems. Even if you’re a beginner just starting out, or an engineer aiming to build enterprise-level RAG and AI agents, this post should support you in some way. I’ll cover the fundamentals I started with, the messy real-world challenges, how I learned from codebases, and the realities of working with enterprise clients.

I recently shared a technical post on building RAG agents at scale and also a business breakdown on how to find and work with enterprise clients, and the response was overwhelming – thank you. But most importantly, many people wanted to know *how I actually learned these concepts*. So I thought I’d share some of the insights and approaches that worked for me.

**The Reality of Production Work**

Building a simple chatbot on top of a vector DB is easy — but that’s not what companies are paying for. The real value comes from building RAG systems that work at scale and survive the messy realities of production. That’s why companies pay serious money for working systems — because so few people can actually deliver them.

**Why RAG Isn’t Going Anywhere**

Before I get into it, I just want to share why RAG is so important and why its need is only going to keep growing. RAG isn’t hype. It solves problems that won’t vanish:

* Context limits: Even 200K-token models choke after \~100–200 pages. Enterprise repositories are 1,000x bigger. And usable context is really \~120K before quality drops off.
* Fine-tuning ≠ knowledge injection: It changes style, not content. You can teach terminology (like “MI” = myocardial infarction) but you can’t shove in 50K docs without catastrophic forgetting.
* Enterprise reality: Metadata, quality checks, hybrid retrieval – these aren’t solved. That’s why RAG engineers are in demand.
* The future: Data grows faster than context, reliable knowledge injection doesn’t exist yet, and enterprises need audit trails + real-time compliance. RAG isn’t going away.

**Foundation**

Before I knew what I was doing, I jumped into code too fast and wasted weeks. If I could restart, I’d begin with fundamentals. Andrew Ng’s deeplearning ai courses on RAG and agents are a goldmine. Free, clear, and packed with insights that shortcut months of wasted time. Don’t skip them – you need a solid base in embeddings, LLMs, prompting, and the overall tool landscape.

**Recommended courses:**

* Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
* LLMs as Operating Systems: Agent Memory
* Long-Term Agentic Memory with LangGraph
* How Transformer LLMs Work
* Building Agentic RAG with LlamaIndex
* Knowledge Graphs for RAG
* Building Apps with Vector Databases

I also found the *AI Engineer* YouTube channel surprisingly helpful. Most of their content is intro-level, but the conference talks helped me see how these systems break down in practice. **First build:** Don’t overthink it. Use LangChain or LlamaIndex to set up a Q&A system with clean docs (Wikipedia, research papers). The point isn’t to impress anyone – it’s to get comfortable with the retrieval → generation flow end-to-end.

**Core tech stack I started with:**

* Vector DBs (Qdrant locally, Pinecone in the cloud)
* Embedding models (OpenAI → Nomic)
* Chunking (fixed, semantic, hierarchical)
* Prompt engineering basics

What worked for me was building the same project across multiple frameworks. At first it felt repetitive, but that comparison gave me intuition for tradeoffs you don’t see in docs.

**Project ideas:** A recipe assistant, API doc helper, or personal research bot. Pick something you’ll actually use yourself. When I built a bot to query my own reading list, I suddenly cared much more about fixing its mistakes.

**Real-World Complexity**

Here’s where things get messy – and where you’ll learn the most. At this point I didn’t have a strong network. To practice, I used ChatGPT and Claude to roleplay different companies and domains. It’s not perfect, but simulating real-world problems gave me enough confidence to approach actual clients later. What you’ll quickly notice is that the easy wins vanish. Edge cases, broken PDFs, inconsistent formats – they eat your time, and there’s no Stack Overflow post waiting with the answer.

**Key skills that made a difference for me:**

* Document Quality Detection: Spotting OCR glitches, missing text, structural inconsistencies. This is where “garbage in, garbage out” is most obvious.
* Advanced Chunking: Preserving hierarchy and adapting chunking to query type. Fixed-size chunks alone won’t cut it.
* Metadata Architecture: Schemas for classification, temporal tagging, cross-references. This alone ate \~40% of my dev time.

One client had half their repository duplicated with tiny format changes. Fixing that felt like pure grunt work, but it taught me lessons about data pipelines no tutorial ever could.

**Learn from Real Codebases**

One of the fastest ways I leveled up: cloning open-source agent/RAG repos and tearing them apart. Instead of staring blankly at thousands of lines of code, I used Cursor and Claude Code to generate diagrams, trace workflows, and explain design choices. Suddenly gnarly repos became approachable.

For example, when I studied OpenDevin and Cline (two coding agent projects), I saw two totally different philosophies of handling memory and orchestration. Neither was “right,” but seeing those tradeoffs taught me more than any course.

My advice: don’t just read the code. Break it, modify it, rebuild it. That’s how you internalize patterns. It felt like an unofficial apprenticeship, except my mentors were GitHub repos.

**When Projects Get Real**

Building RAG systems isn’t just about retrieval — that’s only the starting point. There’s absolutely more to it once you enter production. Everything up to here is enough to put you ahead of most people. But once you start tackling real client projects, the game changes. I’m not giving you a tutorial here – it’s too big a topic – but I want you to be aware of the challenges you’ll face so you’re not blindsided. If you want the deep dive on solving these kinds of enterprise-scale issues, I’ve posted a full technical guide in the comments — worth checking if you’re serious about going beyond the basics.

Here are the realities that hit me once clients actually relied on my systems:

* **Reliability under load**: Systems must handle concurrent searches and ongoing uploads. One client’s setup collapsed without proper queues and monitoring — resilience matters more than features.
* **Evaluation and testing**: Demos mean nothing if users can’t trust results. Gold datasets, regression tests, and feedback loops are essential.
* **Business alignment**: Tech fails if staff aren’t trained or ROI isn’t clear. Adoption and compliance matter as much as embeddings.
* **Domain messiness**: Healthcare jargon, financial filings, legal precedents — every industry has quirks that make or break your system.
* **Security expectations**: Enterprises want guarantees: on‑prem deployments, role‑based access, audit logs. One law firm required every retrieval call to be logged immutably.

This is the stage where side projects turn into real production systems.

**The Real Opportunity**

If you push through this learning curve, you’ll have rare skills. Enterprises everywhere need RAG/agent systems, but very few engineers can actually deliver production-ready solutions. I’ve seen it firsthand – companies don’t care about flashy demos. They want systems that handle their messy, compliance-heavy data. That’s why deals go for $50K–$200K+. It’s not easy: debugging is nasty, the learning curve steep. But that’s also why demand is so high. If you stick with it, you’ll find companies chasing *you*.

So start building. Break things. Fix them. Learn. Solve real problems for real people. The demand is there, the money is there, and the learning never stops.

And I’m curious: what’s been the hardest real-world roadblock you’ve faced in building or even just experimenting with RAG systems? Or even if you’re just learning more in this space, I’m happy to help in any way.

*Note: I used Claude for grammar/formatting polish and formatting for better readability*
